# Exercise 02

Working with Expressions

## Prerequisite

Haskell `stack` is installed on the machine you are using.


## Task

1. Open a command-line window and navigate to CSU34016-1920/Exercise02
2. Enter `stack test`.
3. The tests fail: read the test outcome carefully.
4. Your task is to edit `src/Ex02.hs` to:
  1. Change the first line to contain your name and TCD username
  2. Get all the tests to pass.
  3. Check your changes by running `stack test` again.
5. To submit, simply upload **only** your revised `Ex02.hs` file to Blackboard. Do **not** rename the file in any way.
